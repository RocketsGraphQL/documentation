## Authentication

Currently, everyone can select and insert todos. That is ok to start with but now it's time to secure our API by adding authentication.

Authentication is built-in to RocketGraph and easy to get started.

### Install and configure rocket-js-sdk

> rocket-js-sdk is an open-source JavaScript library for interacting with RocketGraph's auth

In your example-setups
```bash
cd auth
yarn install
yarn start
```


Please don't forget to replace `https://backend-REPLACE` with your backend endpoint endpoint.
