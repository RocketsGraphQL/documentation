## Create React App

Coming back, now lets create a basic react app to consume our Graph APIs and experiment on this todos `table`.
Do
```bash
git clone https://github.com/RocketsGraphQL/example-setups
cd todos
yarn install
yarn start
```
to spin up a basic react application

Don't forget to replace the gqlEndpoint in index.js with the url of your gql hasura endpoint
