After you `create-react-app` use the following in `utils/config.js` file to start a client.
Import from App.js and use the Auth methods


```js
import { createClient } from "@rocketgraphql/rocketgraph-js-sdk";

const config = {
  baseURL: "https://backend-xxxxx.rocketgraph.app/api",
};

const { auth } = createClient(config);

export { auth };
```


You should be able to import auth with

```js
import { auth } from "utils/config";
```

Refer to next section on how to use Auth.
