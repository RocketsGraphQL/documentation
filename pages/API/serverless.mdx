# Serverless Functions

You can use serverless functions to deploy your own backend code as AWS Lambdas. First download [`rgraph plugin`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/rgraph) Simply go to the folder containing the code(We support only Node 16 for now) and execute `rgraph deploy <project name>`. Use the [Nodejs handler for AWS Lambdas](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/nodejs-handler.html) to write your functions.
