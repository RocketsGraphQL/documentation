# Introduction
You will need a basic understanding of Javascript to follow this article. In this docs, you will find examples on how to build, todos applications, authentication, Rocketgraph APIs and advanced Postgres logging.

## What is Rocketgraph?

Rocketgraph let's you build production grade web applications in minutes. Rocketgraph provides a **PostgresDB**, **Authentications**, **Hasura console** to manage your **GraphQL API** and "subscribe" to your data, **serverless functions** and **Postgres logging** right out of the box. So you don't have to build your own backend. It's front-end agnostic, so your can just write your own front-end and connect it to Rocketgraph backend. Apart from it, Rocketgraph also provides **AI studio** to build your own chatbots from your documentation website. Check out how.
